    "Recently, I've been connecting medical and healthcare professionals to patients and procedures in video calls working in Med-Tech and Health-Tech. In these roles I've built UI in mobile, desktop, and web applications that extend the reach of healthcare beyond the immediate community.",
    "I earned my Bachelors's Degree in Psychology from the University of California in Santa Cruz then honed my problem-solving skills working and managing in some of the San Francisco Bay Area's canonical kitchens. Cooking and food have long been passions of mine. Working in the Food Industry has taught me to work in high-stress environments, collaborate with and grow a team, and how to constantly strive for an optimal solution even when everything was \"perfect\" for that one moment. However, I still have an eye on how to refactor with the hopes of Future-proofing",
    "I'm successful as a Web Developer because of my mix of design and coding skills, and my creative problem-solving. I know how to get seamless user interaction on complex full-stack development projects. I focus on finding the right solution for my clients: whether it means choosing a tried-and-true pattern or going with an elegant but unconventional approach.",
    "In my free time, I can be found exploring the Bay Area with my family, running with (or getting run by) my sweet rescue dog, and tasting local craft brews and food. Oh! And making Dad jokes and puns -- the more painful the better!"
